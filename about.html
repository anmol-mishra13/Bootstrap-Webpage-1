        <h1 class="text-center"> History </h1>
        <p class="txt"> Originally created by a designer and a developer at Twitter, Bootstrap has become one of the
            most
            popular
            front-end frameworks and open source projects in the world.

            Bootstrap was created at Twitter in mid-2010 by @mdo and @fat. Prior to being an open-sourced framework,
            Bootstrap was known as Twitter Blueprint. A few months into development, Twitter held its first Hack Week
            and the project exploded as developers of all skill levels jumped in without any external guidance. It
            served as the style guide for internal tools development at the company for over a year before its public
            release, and continues to do so today.

            Originally released on Friday, August 19, 2011, we’ve since had over twenty releases, including two major
            rewrites with v2 and v3. With Bootstrap 2, we added responsive functionality to the entire framework as an
            optional stylesheet. Building on that with Bootstrap 3, we rewrote the library once more to make it
            responsive by default with a mobile first approach.

            With Bootstrap 4, we once again rewrote the project to account for two key architectural changes: a
            migration to Sass and the move to CSS’s flexbox. Our intention is to help in a small way to move the web
            development community forward by pushing for newer CSS properties, fewer dependencies, and new technologies
            across more modern browsers.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Early Beginnings</strong> <br> Bootstrap, originally named Twitter Blueprint, was developed by Mark
            Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter as a framework to encourage consistency across internal tools. Before
            Bootstrap, various libraries were used for interface development, which led to inconsistencies and a high
            maintenance burden. According to Twitter developer Mark Otto:

            A super small group of developers and I got together to design and build a new internal tool and saw an
            opportunity to do something more. Through that process, we saw ourselves build something much more
            substantial than another internal tool. Months later, we ended up with an early version of Bootstrap as a
            way to document and share common design patterns and assets within the company.[3]

            After a few months of development by a small group, many developers at Twitter began to contribute to the
            project as a part of Hack Week, a hackathon-style week for the Twitter development team. It was renamed from
            Twitter Blueprint to Bootstrap, and released as an open source project on August 19, 2011.[4] It has
            continued to be maintained by Mark Otto, Jacob Thornton, and a small group of core developers, as well as a
            large community of contributors </p>

        <h1 class="display-1">Versions</h1>
        <h2 class="display-2">Bootstrap 2</h2>
        <p> On January 31, 2012, Bootstrap 2 was released, which added built-in support for Glyphicons, several new
            components, as well as changes to many of the existing components. This version supports responsive web
            design, meaning the layout of web pages adjusts dynamically, taking into account the characteristics of the
            device used (whether desktop, tablet, or mobile phone).
        </p>
        <h1 class="display-2">Bootstrap 3</h1>
        <p>On August 19, 2013, Bootstrap 3, was released. It redesigned components to use flat design and a mobile first
            approach. Bootstrap 3 features new plugin system with namespaced events. Bootstrap 3 dropped Internet
            Explorer 7 and Firefox 3.6 support, but there is an optional polyfil for these browsers
        </p>

            Mark Otto announced Bootstrap 4 on October 29, 2014.[8] The first alpha version of Bootstrap 4 was released
            on August 19, 2015.[9] The first beta version was released on August 10, 2017.[10] Mark suspended work on
            Bootstrap 3 on September 6, 2016, to free up time to work on Bootstrap 4. Bootstrap 4 was finalized on
            January 18, 2018.[11]

            Significant changes include:

        <h1 class="display-1">Features</h1>
        <p>
            Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS & JS Library that focuses on simplifying the development of informative web pages
            (as opposed to web apps). The primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply Bootstrap's choices
            of color, size, font and layout to that project. As such, the primary factor is whether the developers in
            charge find those choices to their liking. Once added to a project, Bootstrap provides basic style
            definitions for all HTML elements. The result is a uniform appearance for prose, tables and form elements
            across web browsers. In addition, developers can take advantage of CSS classes defined in Bootstrap to
            further customize the appearance of their contents. For example, Bootstrap has provisioned for light- and
            dark-colored tables, page headings, more prominent pull quotes, and text with a highlight.

            Bootstrap also comes with several JavaScript components in the form of jQuery plugins. They provide
            additional user interface elements such as dialog boxes, tooltips, and carousels. Each Bootstrap component
            consists of an HTML structure, CSS declarations, and in some cases accompanying JavaScript code. They also
            extend the functionality of some existing interface elements, including for example an auto-complete
            function for input fields.

            Example of a webpage using Bootstrap framework
            Example of a webpage using Bootstrap framework rendered in Firefox
            The most prominent components of Bootstrap are its layout components, as they affect an entire web page. The
            basic layout component is called "Container", as every other element in the page is placed in it. Developers
            can choose between a fixed-width container and a fluid-width container. While the latter always fills the
            width of the web page, the former uses one of the five predefined fixed widths, depending on the size of the
            screen showing :
        <ul>
            <li>Smaller than 576 pixels</li>
            <li>576–768 pixels</li>
            <li>768–992 pixels</li>
            <li>992–1200 pixels</li>
            <li>Larger than 1200 pixels</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <ol class="txt">
            <li><strong> Easy to Begin With</strong><br>
                It is pretty easy, to begin with. Being easy to get started with is probably the first
                quality which makes Bootstrap very appealing.</li>


            <li> <strong>LESS as Well as CSS Files</strong><br>
                Bootstrap not only offers LESS files but also includes the old CSS files.</li>

            <li><strong>Easily Customizable </strong><br>
                Despite the fact that Bootstrap is designed in responsive 12-column grids, layouts, and
                components, it is also very easy to customize. Whether you need a fixed grid or a responsive one, it can
                be made possible by making a few changes. Offsetting and nesting of columns are also easy to do in both
                CPU-based and mobile-based browser grids.</li>

            <li><strong>Responsive Utility Classes</strong><br>
                Another prominent feature of Bootstrap is its responsive utility classes. Using
                responsive utility classes, a particular piece of content can be made to appear or hide only on devices
                depending on the size of the screen being used. This feature is extremely helpful for designers who want
                to make a mobile and tablet-friendly version of their websites.</li>

            <li><strong>Drop-Down Component Menu</strong><br>
                The drop-down component menu is a responsive additive feature of a website. To include
                it in a website, a lot of different plugins, mostly Java-based, are tested. But, via Bootstrap and its
                easy customizing options, this can easily be done in a matter of minutes.</li>

            <ol class="txt">
                Some of the components that come pre-styled in Bootstrap are:
                <li>Drop-downs</li>
                <li>Button</li>
                <li>Navigation</li>
                <li>Badges Alert</li>
                <li>Progress Bar</li>
            </ol>

            <li><strong>Bootstrap Templates</strong><br>
                The readily available templates make it easier for inexperienced users to create a
                website following a simple tutorial or demo available on the Bootstrap.</li>
